This guide is a basic introduction to the development model for Red Eclipse, including the procedure for submitting modifications and creating new ideas.

It is suggested you read this in its entirety before starting any development related work, as it contains vital information regarding proper etiquette.

## Topical Repositories

If you want to chat or need help and support, you should use our [Discussion Area](https://redeclipse.net/discuss) or [Live Chat](https://redeclipse.net/chat).

## Content/Idea/Proposal Guidelines

* Create a piece of content, come up with an idea, or decide to propose a change you want included in Red Eclipse.
* Then, create a discussion for in our [Discussion Area](https://redeclipse.net/discuss).
* Give the community a chance to provide feedback (minimum time should be about 2 weeks).
* When you feel you have come up with a finished work, idea, or proposal, submit it to the appropriate git module as a pull request.
* Provide a good description along with a link to your original forum topic.
* Attach, or provide direct links to, any files you are attempting to have included here.
* Feel free to share a link to your post while we review it.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

* Find an issue in the Red Eclipse game and/or engine, verify that you can reproduce the problem and provide steps on how to do so.
* Check on the [Discussion Area](https://redeclipse.net/discuss) or issue tracker to see if your issue has already been reported and/or resolved upstream.
* When you have verified that the issue still exists and needs to be fixed, submit it to the appropriate git module as an issue or pull request.
* Provide a good description along with a link to your original forum topic (if applicable).
* Attach, or provide direct links to, any files which demonstrates your issue and any patches you might have here.

## General Guidelines

* Only submit finalised works (no work-in-progress items please). If you are just looking for general feedback, you can use the [Discussion Area](https://redeclipse.net/discuss) (or a git fork!).
* You acknowledge we will probably modify your content before including it (to fix any problems or improve it).
* If you want to modify it at a later point, changes you make will need to be based on our version, otherwise we may not include your updates.
* You must provide an explicit, legally enforceable license. Do not use "public domain", or "no commercial use" / "no modification allowed" clauses. If you don't, it will be assumed you are happy to use the Red Eclipse general license which best applies to the work.

If you are unsure about how to license your work, Creative Commons provides a handy selection tool for their licenses at http://creativecommons.org/choose/ and Red Eclipse content is generally licensed "CC by-sa" (Attribution-ShareAlike), unless otherwise specified: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

### A Note on Commit Messages

As of yet, there are no strict rules for formatting of commit messages. However, it is good practice to keep commit messages clean and simple while providing a relatively clear idea of what the commit entails.
