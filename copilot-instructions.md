The code is written in C++11 and should:
- Be concise with limited use of newlines only to separate different concepts or sections.
- Make minimal use of comments, used only to describe a line of thought or reference that the code itself doesn't convey.
- Use CamelCase only for class names. All identifier names should be concise and avoid using underscores.
- Group variables of the same type instead of across new lines.
- Maintain an indent length of 4 spaces and TAB characters should not be used.
- Always be performant with some concessions for aesthetics.
- Bundle loops that only have one conditional or command, so that extra braces and newlines are avoided.
- Make use of the included headers and libraries, and completely avoid including new dependencies.
